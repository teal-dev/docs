<Info>
  Accounting is the record keeping of the flow of value within a business.
  Record keeping is vital for business owners to accurately determine their
  taxes, understand their finances, and make well-informed decisions.

## Transactions

Transactions occur in the real-world and represent the events that modify a company's financial standing. Transactions involve the flow of value between or within companies. This usually involves the flow of real money, but it is not necessarily the case (eg. a credit sale).

Businesses need to account for all of their transactions as part of their legal accounting obligation. There are also many other benefits in doing so (see Use cases).

## Journal Entries

A journal entry is a representation of a transaction in our accounting model.

A journal entry not only represents the value of the transaction, but also its directionality. Directionality is shown by creating line entries that represent it's origin, destination, and value. Journal entries are part of a closed system and are therefore **zero sum**: all outflows from an origin must equal all inflows to the destination(s).

## Line Entries

Each **journal entry** consists of at least **two line entries**. These **line entries** either represent a _credit_ or _debit_.

By modelling a transaction as the flow of value between an origin and a destination, a _credit_ can be thought of as the flow "from" the origin, while a _debit_ represents the flow "to" the destination. This concept is best understood through examples.

#### Example 1: Purchase of Inventory on Credit

| Account          | Debit ($) | Credit ($) |
| ---------------- | --------: | ---------: |
| Inventory        |     5,000 |            |
| Accounts Payable |           |      5,000 |

<Info>
  In this transaction, inventory is being purchased on credit. To represent the
  flow of value into the inventory account, it is debited with $5,000. The
  accounts payable account, which is the origin of this inflow, is credited with
  $5,000.

#### Example 2: Payment of Office Expenses

| Account         | Debit ($) | Credit ($) |
| --------------- | --------: | ---------: |
| Rent Expense    |     2,000 |            |
| Utility Expense |       500 |            |
| Cash / Bank     |           |      2,500 |

<Info>
  In this transaction, the company is making a single $2,500 payment for two
  types of office expenses, rent and utilities. To represent that inflow of
  value to the rent and utility expense accounts, they are debited by $2,000 and
  $500 respectively. The cash or bank account is credited with $2,500 to record
  the outflow of cash from the company for making these expense payments.

## Ledgers

Ledgers consolidate related journal entries, creating a summarized record of certain types of real world transactions. This organization makes it easier for businesses to monitor and control specific aspects of their finances. Ledgers are categorized as one of five types: revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, or equity.

1. **Revenues:** Earnings from the company's operating activities.
2. **Expenses:** Costs incurred to generate revenues.
3. **Assets:** Company-owned resources with future economic value, tangible or intangible.
4. **Liabilities:** Financial obligations or debts of the company.
5. **Equity:** The ownership interest in the company after deducting liabilities from assets.

Revenues and expenses relate to the company's performance over a period, while assets, liabilities, and equity reflect the financial position at a given point. By grouping these related accounts together, businesses can create detailed financial reports (including the three core financial statements) to calculate their tax obligation and make more informed, data-driven decisions.

## Ledger Sets

Ledger sets or "chart of accounts" is a comprehensive, mutually exclusive listing of all ledgers (or accounts) used by a company. A company's chart of accounts typically reflects the unique structure of the business, and so there is no single standard. However, there are certain protocols that companies are expected to follow when filing their taxes with the IRS.
