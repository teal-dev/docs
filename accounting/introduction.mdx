## What we do

We provide the infrastructure for platforms to build accounting products that are tailored to their end users.

### The Teal value proposition

1. All small businesses need accounting.
2. Most rely on cumbersome workflows and outdated point solutions that
   exist away from their preferred platform.
3. We believe that accounting should be an integrated part of a modern
   financial stack that exists on one platform managed by those that understand
   their users best.
4. At a minimum, a good accounting solution works with little human input. At
   best, it leads to better financial outcomes.
