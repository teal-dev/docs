Using information from ledger sets, they're usually presented in three forms: the **cash flow statement**, the **income statement**, and the **balance sheet**.

## Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement displays how money flows in and out of a business over a period. It comprises of three main sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

1. **Operating activities** include the company's primary business operations, like selling goods, providing services, paying salaries, or buying inventory.
2. **Investing activities** involve changes in assets, equipment, or investments.
3. **Financing activities** include transactions with owners and creditors, such as issuing stock or paying dividends.

A simple cashflow statement might look like this:

The income statement, also known as a profit and loss statement, reflects a company's revenues, costs, and profits over a period. It begins with the company's sales or revenues, then deducts the costs of doing business, including cost of goods sold, operating expenses, tax expenses, and interest expenses.
