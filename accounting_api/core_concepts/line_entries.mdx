Line entries are the most basic atomic unit of accounting in Teal. 

Each line entry has an **amount**, a **direction**, and a **ledger**. The **amount** is the amount of value that is 
flowing into or out of a ledger. The direction can be either **debit** or **credit**.

Debits and credits are tricky, even for accounting experts, but you can generally think of them this way:

- **Debit:** A debit is a flow of value _into_ a ledger.
- **Credit:** A credit is a flow of value _out of_ a ledger.

A business cannot create or destroy money, only transfer it from one place to another. Therefore, the sum of credits in any set of 
line entries must equal the sum of debits. Debits = credits is one of the most foundational rules of accounting. 
Teal has multiple safeguards to ensure this is true, so you don't need to worry about violating this rule when using Teal.

In Teal, line entries cannot be created directly. Instead, they are created only as part of a journal entry. This is one of the built in safeguards.
