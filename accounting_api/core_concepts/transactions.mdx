Transactions in Teal represent real-world transactions, like those found in bank accounts and credit cards. 
They have a date, amount, and description, and often include additional useful metadata that comes from banking and BaaS systems, 
such as merchant details.

Transactions in Teal are used to bridge between the world of payments and banking, and the world of accounting. 
Teal is designed to allow you to [submit transactions](/transactions/submitting) in more or less 
raw format, and have Teal do the work of properly transforming this data into journal entries and line entries for use in accounting.
