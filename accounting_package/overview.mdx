An accounting package is a general ledger (GL) system used to store accounting data. Many small business use popular 
packages such as QuickBooks Online for their accounting, but a large percentage of small businesses don't use any accounting 
package at all. These business will often use general tools such as spreadsheets. 

Our API enables you to build accounting features regardless of the accounting package your customers currently use. We have 
designed our endpoints so that you can focus on accounting use cases while we do the work of syncing accounting data.  

We current support syncing to QuickBooks or your own accounting package, which we call `PlatformGL`. We will be adding more 
popular accounting packages soon.
