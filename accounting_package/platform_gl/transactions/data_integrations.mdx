Use our data integrations so that Teal can do the work of fetching and reconciling transactions from a 3rd party data source.

## Provider Specific Instructions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Plaid">

Utilizing Teal's Plaid integration enables a seamless workflow for connecting external financial accounts to Teal. 
We have an official processor-token [partnership](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/teal/) with Plaid so that your users easily connect their external financial 
accounts directly to Teal, through your own Plaid account and UX.

<Note>This feature is currently in **beta**.</Note>

## Instructions
### Set up your accounts
You'll need accounts at both [Plaid](https://plaid.com) and Teal in order to use the Plaid + Teal integration. You'll also need to enable your 
Plaid account for the Teal integration. If you do not yet have a Plaid account, reach out to your Teal contact so 
that we can help you set one up. 

To enable your Plaid account for the integration, go to the [Integrations](https://dashboard.plaid.com/developers/integrations) section of the 
account dashboard. If the integration is off, simply click the 'Enable' button for Teal to enable the integration.

Finally, you'll need to complete your [Plaid Application Profile](https://dashboard.plaid.com/settings/company/app-branding) in the Dashboard, 
which involves filling out basic information about your app, such as your company name and website. This step helps your end-users learn more 
how your product uses their bank information and is also required for connecting to some banks.

### Implement Plaid Link inside your app
You'll need to implement Plaid link in order to generate a Teal `processor_token` 
so that we can fetch and reconcile transactions. You can find detailed instructions for implementing Plaid Link
[here](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/teal/#create-a-link_token). Please follow these instructions.

<Note> We recommend embedding [Plaid Link](https://plaid.com/docs/link/) as part of a "connect your accounts" workflow or similar. </Note>

### Send us your processor tokens
By following the steps above, you will have implemented a server-side handler to create Teal `processor_token`s. You'll want to send us these 
`processor_token`s via the [link Plaid account](/api-reference/transaction-sources/link-plaid-account) endpoint and we will use it to automatically set 
up financial account ledgers and begin to securely retrieve transaction data.

You can create Teal processor tokens in all three of the Plaid API environments: [Sandbox](https://sandbox.plaid.com), [Development](https://development.plaid.com), 
and [Production](https://production.plaid.com), however we require that you use your Plaid Production token in order to work with real transaction data.

### Manage connections using webhooks
Once your user has connected a financial account via Plaid, Teal does the work of syncing transactions. However, Plaid can sometimes 
run into issues connecting to your user’s financial accounts. For example, some banks require users to reauthenticate their Plaid 
connection every 90 days. In such a case, you would need to ask your users to go through the Plaid Link flow to reconnect their account.

We make it easy for you to know when to take action by passing you events via webhooks. We use a popular third-party service called [SVIX](https://www.svix.com/) 
to handle our outgoing webhooks. These events will include messages from Plaid, such as errors codes. For all possible Plaid error codes and recommended actions, see the full 
listing of [Plaid error codes](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/).

### Register to receive webhooks
You can register for webhooks via the `POST /webhooks/register` endpoint. Once registered, you will have access to the **Webhook Dashboard** in the developer portal. 

### Configure your endpoints
You can add an endpoint via the **Webhook Dashboard** by navigating to the Endpoints tab and clicking Add an Endpoint. Under Endpoint URL, enter 
the url that Teal should send messages to. We recommend that you configure the endpoint to receive all messages, but you do have the option 
filter by message type. You may want to configure separate endpoints for each message type, depending on your preferred implementation. You can 
also configure rate limits under Advanced Configuration. 

Events and their associated messages can also be viewed in the Logs tab, even without an endpoint setup. However, we recommend that you 
subscribe to events so that you know when to prompt your users to take action.

After creating your endpoint, you can test your application code by navigating to Endpoints > Testing and selecting an event to send to your endpoint. 

<Note>
When processing messages sent by Teal, please return a 2xx status code so we know you received the message. Additionally you may need to 
disable CSRF protection on this route.
</Note>

### Set up webhook verification
To keep your application secure, it is important for you to implement a way to verify the webhooks that we send to you. We recommend that you make 
use of the [Svix library](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how), though you can also choose to do this manually.  

For other information on receiving webhooks, we recommend reading [SVIX’s documentation](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/introduction).

  <Tab title="Unit">

We have an integration with Unit so that we can do the work of automatically fetching the transaction data from your Unit built banking 
products.

You will need to generate a token from Unit by logging in to the <a href="https://app.s.unit.sh/api-tokens">API tokens page</a> in 
the Unit dashboard. We requires a token with read permission for transactions.

Once you have this token you can paste it into our [Developer Portal integrations page](https://developer.teal.dev/integrations). 
and immediately be able to work with Sandbox data from Unit in Teal. 

Please note that in order to work with production data from Unit in Teal, you will need to contact Unit to enable production data 
access. Generally speaking, Unit will need to contact your sponsoring bank to get their explicit permission before granting access 
to production data to any 3rd parties such as Teal.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stripe Treasury">
Stripe Treasury currently does not support data access for 3rd parties such as Teal, however, they currently have partner tokens in 
active development. For an update on timelines, please reach out to your Stripe Treasury support contact.

In the mean time, you can still submit transactions to Teal directly by using the 
[Create Transactions endpoint](/api-reference/transactions/create-transactions). See the [submitting transactions guide](/accounting_package/platform_gl/transactions/submitting) 
for details on how to proceed.
