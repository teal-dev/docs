Your end user's accounting reports will only be accurate if they mirror the real-world financial activities of their business. 

Putting their transactions data into Teal is the primary way to reflect these real-world financial activities inside your 
end user's accounting. This is harder than it sounds to get right - edge cases abound. But Teal is designed to help you, and the 
end user, to get it right. 

This section breaks down how to get transactions into Teal and then apply the appropriate accounting treatment (i.e. categorizing the transaction).

There are two ways to get transactions data into Teal: you can submit them directly or you can use our data integrations so that 
Teal can do the work for you.
