The goal of putting transactions data in Teal is for an end user (small business) to have a complete and accurate representation of their transactions. If the transactions in Teal don't reflect the transactions in the outside world, then their accounting reports will be wrong. It's harder than it sounds to get this right - edge cases abound. But Teal is designed to help you, and the end user, to get it right.

In order for an end user to successfully represent their accounting in Teal, they must have a separate ledger in Teal for each financial account they need to track, and each ledger must contain the complete set of transactions within that financial account. This section breaks down how to set up these financial account ledgers appropriately, how to submit transactions, reconcile them (i.e. double check that we have the full set), and then apply the appropriate accounting treatment to them in a later step.

This section walks through how to achieve this.
