The first step to submitting your user's transactions is to map their real-world financial accounts, such as their 
bank account, to a corresponding ledger in their chart of accounts. The process works a bit differently 
depending on the end user's accounting package. This section outlines how the process works for `PlatformGL` 
and `QuickBooks`.

    <Steps>

    <Step title="Create a financial account ledger">
        Real-world financial accounts are represented by financial account ledgers. You create these ledgers in the 
        same way you create any ledger, by using the [Create Ledger](/api-reference/ledgers/create_ledger) endpoint. 

        Financial account ledgers must have a `financial_account_type`. By selecting the financial account type, we 
        set smart defaults to ensure that the accounting treatment is accurate. For example, setting `financial_account_type` to 
        `bank` automatically sets `type` to `asset`, `debit_credit` to `debit`, and `report_cash_flow` to `true`.

        <Tip> 
        Each real-world financial acount should have its own individual ledger. You can see the complete list of supported financial 
        account types [here](/api-reference/ledgers/create_ledger). 
        </Tip> 
    </Step>

    <Step title="Map the ledger">
        Once you have created a financial account ledger, you must store the association between the `ledger_id` of the 
        financial account ledger and the real-world financial account it represents.

        We call this mapping, and you will use this mapping for various use cases such as submitting transactions. 
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Set the opening balance">
        It is important that the balance of the financial account ledger matches that of the real-world financial account on 
        your user's [start date](/accounting_package/add_instance#start-date), or else their accounting will be inacurate. 

        If the real-world financial account was opened before your user's [start date](/accounting_package/add_instance#start-date), 
        an opening balance must be set via the [Opening Balance](/api-reference/ledgers/set-ledger-opening-balance) endpoint. 
    </Step>

        #### Best practices
        <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Map financial account ledgers at the beginning">
            If you already have access to financial accounts for the customer, for example because you already 
            serve them a banking or payroll product, then it's a good idea to create a ledger for each financial 
            account as soon as you create the user's account in Teal.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Give descriptive names to ledgers">
            When creating a financial account ledger, it's important to give it a descriptive name so 
            the end user can distinguish which account is which in case they ever open a 2nd account 
            of the same type. We recommend using a naming convention that includes the last 4 digits 
            of the account number, which is generally considered not to be sensitive information. For 
            security and compliance reasons, we do not recommend including any more digits than the last four.

            For example, "Chase Checking \*\*5959" is a good name for a ledger, whereas "Bank Account 1" is not.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Make ledgers representing platform controlled financial accounts non-editable">
            If you control the financial account (e.g. via a neobanking/Baas offering), then you may 
            want to make the ledger non-user-editable by setting the `user_editable` parameter to False 
            when using the [Create Ledger endpoint](/api-reference/ledgers/create-ledger). This will 
            prevent the user from editing any line entry that is assigned to the ledger. They will still 
            be able to categorize the transactions and edit the rest of the journal entry. This feature 
            ensures that the user does not accidently break the sync between the Teal ledger and the 
            transactions submitted from the financial account.

            For example, if you submit a transaction for a \$10 expense for "Starbucks" using the 
            [Create Transaction endpoint](/api-reference/transactions/create-transactions), Teal will automatically generate a 
            journal entry with two line entries. One line entry will credit \$10 to the bank account ledger, 
            the other line entry will debit \$10 to an expense ledger (depending on your 
            [auto-categorization config](/accounting_package/platform_gl/configuration/categorization_config)). If the bank account ledger 
            is set to user_editable = False, then the user will be able to change the \$10 debit to the 
            expense ledger, but not the \$10 credit to the bank account ledger.

  <Tab title="QuickBooks">

    <Note> 
        For `QuickBooks` instances, you do not have full control over your user's chart of accounts. You can't know for sure 
        if a ledger that represents your user's real-world financial account already exists, or if you need to create a new one 
        in order to complete the mapping.
        
        Therefore, you will need to get input from your user.
        </Note> 

    <Steps>

    <Step title="Identify the ledger in QuickBooks">
        We recommend creating an interface that presents the user's chart of accounts and asks them to select the ledger 
        that represents the real-world financial account that you want to map. Use the [Get Ledgers](/api-reference/ledgers/get-ledgers) 
        endpoint to generate the list.  If a ledger does not yet exist, then create one using the 
        [Create Ledger](/api-reference/ledgers/create-ledger) endpoint.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Map the ledger">
        Once the user has identified the ledger to be used, or you have created a new ledger, you must store the association between 
        the `id` and the real-world financial account it represents.

        We call this mapping, and you will use this mapping for various use cases such as submitting transactions. 
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Link the Account">
        In order to be able to submit transactions to the mapped ledger, you need to call the [Link Account](/api-reference/quickbooks/link-account) 
        endpoint and set the `financial_account_type`. Setting the financial account type also lets Teal know that transactions can 
        be written to this QuickBooks ledger. 
        
        By setting the financial account type, we also set smart defaults to ensure that the accounting treatment is accurate. For example,  
        if you set `financial_account_type` to bank, we set `type` to asset, `debit_credit` to debit, and `report_cash_flow` to true.
