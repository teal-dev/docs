PlatformGL is your own accounting package hosted by Teal. It is typically used to build simple accounting features for 
your small business customers that don't currently use an accounting package for the accounting. 

All of our endpoints are compatable with `PlatformGL` instances except for those containing the `\quickbooks` in their route.
