Our QuickBooks integration allows you to both read from and write to QuickBooks, simply by connecting the user's QuickBooks account and then using the Teal endpoints as normal. This allows you to abstract away whether your end customer is using your standalone app, QuickBooks, Xero, or another accounting package. Write one front-end and support them all.

You can also use this integration to sync objects such as invoices, customers, and bills, making Teal the only integration you need to support your fintech products. These objects are currently only available in the QuickBooks beta, but can be used with or without QuickBooks once you are provisioned for them.

<Note>QuickBooks integration is currently in **beta**. Please reach out to your Teal contact to get access.</Note>

This guide will walk you through how to set up your QuickBooks Online integration so that you can connect to your customer’s QuickBooks accounts. 

## Set up your QuickBooks app
A QuickBooks “app” manages the way your customers grant you permission to access their accounting data within QuickBooks. The app manages 
the authorization process and generates secure access tokens that Teal uses to read/write accounting data. We take care of the app development for you. 

## Make the authorization flow accessible in your user interface
Once we set up your app, you will need to provide a visible link for your customers to connect their QuickBooks account. This link is a magic 
link, and it will trigger the authorization flow.

You can create a magic link for your user via our API. You will need the `qb_app_id` and a `redirect_url`, which determines where your user will 
be returned to after authenticating.

When your user follows the magic link, they will be redirected to QuickBooks in order to authorize our QuickBooks app to access their data. After 
successfully signing in to QuickBooks, they will be redirected to the redirect_url that was set when creating their magic link.
