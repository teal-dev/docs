## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps to begin embedding Teal into your application.

Teal APIs are accessible using REST and can be reached via two different endpoints.

- **Sandbox:** `https://api.sandbox.teal.dev`
- **Production:** `https://api.teal.dev`

Our sandbox environment is separate from our production environment. Sandbox is intended to be used during development. Production data should not be stored in the sandbox.

<Warning>
  The API is in an early version 0 state and is currently not stable. There may
  be breaking changes.
</Warning>

## Steps

1. **Provision your platform**
2. **Create a developer account**
3. **Generate your API token**
4. **Make your first API call**

## 1. Provision your platform

A platform is Teal's representation of your business, with its own configuration, data, and users. All of Teal's APIs operate within the scope of a platform.

We provision your platform for you. If you do not already have a provisioned platform, reach out to your Teal contact or visit the [Teal home page](https://teal.dev) to get in touch.

## 2. Create a developer account

Once we have provisioned your platform, you will be able to access our [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). The first time you visit the portal you will need to create an account using your email.

<Note>
  Your email must match the email we have on file. If you want to use a
  different email for access or add additional developer emails, please reach
  out to us.
</Note>

## 3. Generate your API token

Once you are in the developer platform, you can create API tokens to access the API. Calls to our API are authenticated using a bearer token and are sent to our API using an `Authentication: Bearer <token>` HTTP header.

<Warning>
  Tokens should always be kept secret. Don't share outside of your organization
  and be careful when sharing within.
</Warning>

Tokens can be managed at our [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). You will only be able to generate tokens after a platform has been provisioned for your company.

## 4. Make your first API call

Test that you have successfully created an API token for your platform. Run the following cURL command in your client or do so from our [API Reference](/api-reference/authentication), replacing `{API token}` with the appropriate values for your sandbox platform.

```bash Shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/platform' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {API token}'
```

If successful, you should see a response that looks like the following:

```json JSON
{
  "id": 18327,
  "name": "Pauly's Pet Palace"
}
```
