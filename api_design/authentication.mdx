Calls to our API are authenticated using a bearer token and are sent to our API using an `Authentication: Bearer <token>` HTTP header.

<Warning>
  Tokens should always be kept secret. Don't share outside of your organization
  and be careful when sharing within.
</Warning>

Tokens can be managed at our [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). You will only be able to generate tokens after a Platform has been provisioned for your company.
