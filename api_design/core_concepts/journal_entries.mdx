Journal entries bundle line entries together into understandable flows of value between an origin and a destination.

Each individual journal entry enforces that the debit line entries sum to equal the credits line entries. This ensures that each individual journal entry is a closed system that tells the story of where a certain amount of value came from, and where it went.

Each **journal entry** consists of at least **two line entries**, but complex journal entries can have more than two line entries, as long as the sum of credits equal the sum of debits.

Keep in mind that journal entries record the flow of value, not just the flow of money. It is possible for a flow of value to occur without any money changing hands. For example, if a company makes a sale but the customer has not yet paid, the value of the transaction will generally be recorded on the date the invoice was issued, even though no payment has yet been made. Another example is depreciation: over time, equipment breaks down and becomes less valuable. The business will generally create a journal entry to record this loss of value, even though no money has changed hands. A journal entry that records a flow of value with no transfer of funds is called an **accrual**. Whereas a journal entry that records a flow of funds is often called a **cash** entry, regardless of whether the transaction was made electronically or with physical cash. Teal supports accounting for both cash and accrual entries.

Let's take a look at some examples of common journal entries.

### Example 1: Purchase of supplies from a credit card

| Ledger           | Debit ($) | Credit ($) |
| ---------------- | --------: | ---------: |
| Supplies expense |        50 |            |
| Pluto Card *8575 |           |         50 |

<Info>
This is an example of one of the most simple and common types of journal entries. A purchase of \$50 has been made for supplies from a credit card. Since the credit card is the source of the funds, there's a \$50 credit to the card. Since the destination of the funds was an external vendor for supplies, there's a \$50 debit to the supplies expense ledger. Since there is a flow of funds, this is a **cash** entry.

### Example 2: Purchase of inventory without payment

| Account          | Debit ($) | Credit ($) |
| ---------------- | --------: | ---------: |
| Inventory        |     5,000 |            |
| Accounts Payable |           |      5,000 |

<Info>
In this journal entry, \$5,000 of inventory is being purchased, but the purchase invoice has not yet been paid. To represent the flow of value into the inventory account, it is debited with \$5,000. Meanwhile, \$5,000 is credited to the Accounts Payable ledger, to represent the liability that the company has to pay this invoice in the future. Note however that no money has yet changed hands, making this an **accrual** entry.

### Example 3: Payment of salaries

| Account               | Debit ($) | Credit ($) |
| ---------------       | --------: | ---------: |
| Salaries expense      |    85,000 |            |
| Payroll taxes expense |    15,000 |            |
| Pluto Checking *3472  |           |    100,000 |

<Info>
This is an example of one of the most common types of complex journal entries: the bi-weekly payroll. The company transferred 
\$100,000 out of their bank account to a payroll company to pay their employees, in a single lump sum. However, this single 
large transfer was meant to pay for not just salaries, but also the payroll taxes levied by the government. To represent this, 
the company debits the Salaries Expense ledger for \$85,000, and the Payroll Taxes Expense ledger for \$15,000, while entering a 
single credit for \$100,000. Since there is a flow of funds, this is a **cash** entry.
