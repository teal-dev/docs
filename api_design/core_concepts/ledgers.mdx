Ledgers describe the purpose and location of funds and value. Ledgers can be one of five types: revenues, expenses, assets, 
liabilities, or equity.

1. **Revenues:** Money earned from the company's operating activities.
2. **Expenses:** Costs incurred to generate revenues.
3. **Assets:** Company-owned resources with future economic value, tangible or intangible.
4. **Liabilities:** Financial obligations or debts of the company.
5. **Equity:** The ownership interest in the company after deducting liabilities from assets.

Revenues and expenses relate to the company's performance over a period, while assets, liabilities, and equity reflect 
the financial position at a given point. The type of the ledger is used to determine which financial statements the ledger appears on. 
For example, revenues and expenses appear on the income statement, while assets, liabilities, and equity appear on the balance sheet. 

Ledgers are also commonly grouped into sub types that have similar characteristics and accounting treatment. For example, 
asset ledgers are commonly grouped into current assets and non-current asset subtypes. There isn't a single "correct" 
set of ledger subtypes, and subtypes can vary based on accounting convention and preferences. Teal uses a commonly accepted convention for our 
defaults, but you have the ability to modify these based on your preferences.
