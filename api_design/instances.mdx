When working with the API, you will find two to categories of objects: platform-level objects and 
[instance-level](/api-reference/instances/create-instance) objects.

When working with instance-level objects, you must pass the special header `teal-instance-id`, which
shuld contain the Instance ID to be accessed when making the request. For example, here is a request
to get the ledgers for an instance:

``` Shell
curl --request get \
--url 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/ledgers' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'teal-instance-id: <instance_id>'
```
