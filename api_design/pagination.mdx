Our API was designed with responsiveness in mind, and as such, many of our list endpoints have been built
with the ability to paginate through records.


In the API, pagination was implemented using a cursor. Cursor-based pagination gives you a deterministic
result, where not records are skipped between pages. Additionally, cursor-based pagination is more performant
since there is less data to load when navigating between pages.

### How to paginate through records?

When pagination is available, the API will respond with a payload similar to:

```json
{
    "next_page_token": "gAAAAABlSRfLM0b-MzI3NmM0N0MmLWJkOTQtYjkxZTRkMzkyNTE3==",
    "prev_page_token": "gAAAAABlSRfLFpdvYTM3OTQ0Y0OlLWI0YzYtNmYxMjU3N2NmMDk2==",
    "records": []
}
```

As you can see, there are two tokens `next_page_token` and `prev_page_token`. As their name suggest, the `next_page_token` is
used to request the next page, and the `prev_page_token` is used to retrieve the previous page. In addition, when there isn't
a next page or a previous page, the value for either token will be `null`. 

To request the next or previous page, you must pass the url parameter `page_token` with the `next_page_token` value assigned to
it. For example, here is a request to get the next page of Ledgers:

``` Shell
curl --request get \
--url 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/ledgers?page_token=<next_page_token>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'teal-instance-id: <instance_id>'
```

And here is the command to request the previous page:


``` Shell
curl --request get \
--url 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/ledgers?page_token=<prev_page_token>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'teal-instance-id: <instance_id>'
```

Keep in mind that the `page_token` url paramter is optional. If the value is not specified, the first page will be returned
by the API.

### How many records can I retrive?

By default, the API returns 50 records per page, with a maxium value of 100 records per page. This value is configurable by
passing the `limit` attribute as a url param. For example:

``` Shell
curl --request get \
--url 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/ledgers?page_token=<next_page_token>&limit=100' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'teal-instance-id: <instance_id>'
```

The request above will return 100 records for the next page.
