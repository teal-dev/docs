## What is a Chart of Accounts

Every user needs to have a chart of accounts (CoA). A chart of accounts is the full list of ledgers that user has access to when categorizing transactions or creating journal entries. 

<Info>
  A chart of accounts is a comprehensive, mutually exclusive listing of all
  ledgers used by a company. A company's chart of accounts typically reflects
  the unique structure of the business, and so there is no single standard.
  However, there are certain protocols that companies are expected to follow
  when filing their taxes with the IRS.

## Default Charts of Accounts

To assist you in getting set up, your platform will contain four chart of accounts (CoA) templates by default, one for each of the four common entity types:

- **Sole Proprietorship**
- **Partnership**
- **C-Corp**
- **S-Corp**

These default templates are quite comprehensive and not tailored to any specific industry. You may want to modify these defaults so that they are more tailored to the end users that you serve. We recommend that you keep the number of CoAs that you manage at a minimum. We can help you think through this, reach out!

You can manage CoA templates and the ledgers associated with each via the [Chart of Accounts endpoint](/api-reference/chart_of_accounts/get_coa_templates).
