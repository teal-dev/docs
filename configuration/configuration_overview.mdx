The [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/) is where you can configure settings for your accounting platform.

- Chart of accounts
- External data sources
- Auto-categorization
- Create test user

Once you have configured your accounting platform, you can use the [Create User endpoint](/api-reference/users/create_user) to [create and configure a user](/configuration/user_config).
