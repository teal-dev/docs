Use our data integrations so that Teal can do the work for you of fetching and reconciling transactions for you from a 3rd party data source.

### Provider Specific Instructions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Plaid">
  Teal's integration with Plaid is in active development and will be available in September 2023.

In the mean time, you can still submit transactions to Teal directly by using the [Create Transactions endpoint](/api-reference/transactions/create_transactions). See the [transactions guide](/transactions/overview) for details on how to proceed.

  <Accordion title="Unit">
In order to generate a token for Unit, log in to the
<a href="https://app.s.unit.sh/api-tokens">API tokens page</a> in the Unit dashboard.
Teal requires a token with read permission for transactions.

Once this token is pasted into the [Developer Portal integrations page](https://developer.teal.dev/integrations), you will immediately be able to work with Sandbox data from Unit in Teal. See the [transactions guide](/transactions/overview) for details on how to proceed.

Please note that in order to work with production data from Unit in Teal, you will need to contact Unit to enable production data access. Generally speaking, Unit will need to contact your sponsoring bank to get their explicit permission before granting access to production data to any 3rd parties such as Teal.
