Use our data integrations so that Teal can do the work of fetching and reconciling transactions for you from a 3rd party data source.

## Provider Specific Instructions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Plaid">

We have an official processor-token [partnership](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/teal/) with Plaid so that your users easily connect their external financial 
accounts directly to Teal.

<Note>This feature is currently in **beta**. Please reach out to your Teal contact to get access.</Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Unit">

In order to generate a token for Unit, log in to the
<a href="https://app.s.unit.sh/api-tokens">API tokens page</a> in the Unit dashboard.
Teal requires a token with read permission for transactions.

Once this token is pasted into the [Developer Portal integrations page](https://developer.teal.dev/integrations), you will immediately be able to work with Sandbox data from Unit in Teal. See the [transactions guide](/transactions/overview) for details on how to proceed.

Please note that in order to work with production data from Unit in Teal, you will need to contact Unit to enable production data access. Generally speaking, Unit will need to contact your sponsoring bank to get their explicit permission before granting access to production data to any 3rd parties such as Teal.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stripe Treasury">
Stripe Treasury currently does not support data access for 3rd parties such as Teal, however, they currently have partner tokens in active development. For an update on timelines, please reach out to your Stripe Treasury support contact.

In the mean time, you can still submit transactions to Teal directly by using the [Create Transactions endpoint](/api-reference/transactions/create_transactions). See the [transactions guide](/transactions/overview) for details on how to proceed.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Quickbooks">

Our Quickbooks integration allows you to both read from and write to Quickbooks, simply by connecting the user's Quickbooks account and then using the Teal endpoints as normal. This allows you to abstract away whether your end customer is using your standalone app, Quickbooks, Xero, or another accounting package. Write one front-end and support them all.

You can also use this integration to sync objects such as invoices, customers, and bills, making Teal the only integration you need to support your fintech products. These objects are currently only available in the Quickbooks beta, but can be used with or without Quickbooks once you are provisioned for them.

<Note>Quickbooks integration is currently in **beta**. Please reach out to your Teal contact to get access.</Note>
