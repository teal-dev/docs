## Connect to your external data sources

In many cases to you'll want to use Teal to enrich transaction data from third-party financial institutions used by your users, such as a BaaS provider. Teal maintains integrations with major providers.

You can connect to these providers by following these steps:

1. **Retrieve your API token from your desired provider (e.g. Unit, Plaid, Stripe Treasury)**
2. **Log into the [Developer Portal integrations page](https://developer.teal.dev/integrations) and find the card for your provider (see Unit example)**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/save_unit_token.png" />
</Frame>

3. **Paste the API token from your provider into the input, and press the Save Token button.**

After completing these steps, you will be able to use the connected provider's transactions as a data source by [creating a ledger](/transactions/create_ledger) and using the [Transactions Sources endpoints.](/api-reference/transaction_sources)

### Provider Specific Instructions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unit">
In order to generate a token for Unit, log in to the
<a href="https://app.s.unit.sh/api-tokens">API tokens page</a> in the Unit dashboard.
Teal requires a token with read permission for transactions.

Once this token is pasted into the [Developer Portal integrations page](https://developer.teal.dev/integrations), you will immediately be able to work with Sandbox data from Unit in Teal. See the [transactions guide](/transactions/overview) for details on how to proceed.

Please note that in order to work with production data from Unit in Teal, you will need to contact Unit to enable production data access. Generally speaking, Unit will need to contact your sponsoring bank to get their explicit permission before granting access to production data to any 3rd parties such as Teal.
