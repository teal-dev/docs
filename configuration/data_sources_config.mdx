## Connect to your external data sources

In many cases to you'll want to use Teal to enrich transaction data from third-party financial institutions used by your users, such as a BaaS provider. Teal maintains integrations with major providers.

You can connect to these providers by following these steps:

1. **Retrieve your API token from your desired provider (e.g. Unit, Plaid, Stripe Treasury)**
2. **Log into the [Developer Portal integrations page](https://developer.teal.dev/integrations) and find the card for your provider (see Unit example)**

</Frame>

3. **Paste the API token from your provider into the input, and press the Save Token button.**

After completing these steps, you will be able to use the connected provider's transactions as a data source for Teal.
