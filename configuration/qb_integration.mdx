This guide will walk you through how to set up your QuickBooks Online integration so that you can connect to your customer’s QuickBooks accounts. 
Set up your QuickBooks “app”

A QuickBooks “app” manages the way your customers grant you permission to access their accounting data within QuickBooks. The app manages 
the authorization process and generates secure access tokens that Teal uses to read/write accounting data. We take care of the app development for you. 
Make the authorization flow accessible in your user interface
Once we set up your app, you will need to provide a visible link for your customers to connect their QuickBooks account. This link is a magic 
link, and it will trigger the authorization flow.

You can create a magic link for your user via our API. You will need the `qb_app_id` and a `redirect_url`, which determines where your user will 
be returned to after authenticating.

When your user follows the magic link, they will be redirected to QuickBooks in order to authorize our QuickBooks app to access their data. After 
successfully signing in to QuickBooks, they will be redirected to the redirect_url that was set when creating their magic link.
