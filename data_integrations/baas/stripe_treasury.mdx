<Tip>Use our data integrations so that Teal can do the work of fetching and reconciling transactions from a 3rd party data source for you.</Tip>

Stripe Treasury currently does not support data access for 3rd parties such as Teal, however, they currently have partner tokens in active 
development. For an update on timelines, please reach out to your Stripe Treasury support contact.

In the mean time, you can still submit transactions to Teal directly by using the 
[Create Transactions endpoint](/api-reference/transactions/create_transactions). See the [transactions guide](/transactions/overview) for details 
on how to proceed.
