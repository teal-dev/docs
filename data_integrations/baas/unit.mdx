<Tip>Use our data integrations so that Teal can do the work of fetching and reconciling transactions from a 3rd party data source for you.</Tip>

In order to generate a token for Unit, log in to the
<a href="https://app.s.unit.sh/api-tokens">API tokens page</a> in the Unit dashboard.
Teal requires a token with read permission for transactions.

Once this token is pasted into the [Developer Portal integrations page](https://developer.teal.dev/integrations), you will immediately be 
able to work with Sandbox data from Unit in Teal. See the [transactions guide](/transactions/overview) for details on how to proceed.

Please note that in order to work with production data from Unit in Teal, you will need to contact Unit to enable production data access. Generally speaking, Unit will need to 
contact your sponsoring bank to get their explicit permission before granting access to production data to any 3rd parties such as Teal.
