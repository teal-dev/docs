<Tip>Use our data integrations so that Teal can do the work of fetching and reconciling transactions from a 3rd party data source for you.</Tip>

We have an official processor-token [partnership](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/teal/) with Plaid so that your users easily connect their external financial 
accounts directly to Teal.

<Note>This feature is currently in **beta**. Please reach out to your Teal contact to get access.</Note>
