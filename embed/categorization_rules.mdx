Platforms have the ability to set their own categorization rules. This feature enables you to define specific rules, which, when matched, will automatically categorize a transaction into a particular ledger.

Categorization rules are set at the **Platform level**. We don't currently offer User level categorization rules (please contact this if this is an important feature to you).

A rule consists of three components:

- **Priority**: If multiple rules match a transaction, the rule with the highest priority will be implemented first.
- **Expression**: A conditional statement that is evaluated against each transaction to determine whether it satisfies the criteria of the rule.
- **Target Ledger Name**: This is the name of the ledger into which the transaction will be categorized if the rule conditions are met. If the specified ledger name doesn't exist in a user's chart of accounts, the system will disregard the rule.

## Crafting an Expression

The expression is a crucial part of the rule, as it determines the conditions under which a rule matches a transaction. For a rule to be applicable, the expression should evaluate to `True` for a transaction. Any other value will result in a non-match.

### Referencing the Transaction Object

Within the expression, you can reference the transaction object using the symbol `t`. You can access the properties of a transaction using the `.` character. For example, `t.description` will return the description of the transaction.

#### Metadata

Some transactions come with additional information in the form of metadata, an arbitrary key-value map. The specific contents of this map depend on the source of the transaction.

You can access the values in the metadata map within an expression, using the `.` character. For example, `t.metadata.transaction_type` would yield the value mapped to the `transaction_type` key in the metadata.

Here is a generic representation of a Transaction object:

```
Transaction {
  description: String
  datetime: DateTime
  amount: Decimal
  metadata: Map[String, String]
}
```

### Operators and Literals

Expressions may include the following operators and literals:

- **Operators**
  - `and`, `or` for logical AND and OR operations
  - `()` for defining the order of operations
  - `==`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` for equality and comparison
  - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` for mathematical operations
- **If/else Expression**
  - `true_expr **if** boolean_expr **else** false_expr`
- **Literals**

  - Strings: `"string"`
  - Numbers: `1.23`
  - Booleans: `True`, `False`
  - Datetime: `datetime("2023-01-10T00:00:00.000Z")`

### Regular Expressions

You can also use regular expressions in your rule's expression using the `match(pattern, text)` function. You can learn more about regular expressions and their syntax [here](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions).

## Examples

### Payments to a Specific Vendor

A rule that checks if the transaction description contains "Slack":

```python
match("Slack", t.description)
```

### Payments to a specific merchant over a given threshold amount

A rule that applies to any transaction where the vendor is "Chevron" and the amount is more than $50:

```python
match("Chevron", t.description) and t.amount > 50
```

### Transactions with Certain Metadata

A rule that looks for transactions with a `counterparty` attribute in the metadata set to "Sophie's Contracting LLC":

```python
t.metadata.counterparty == "Sophie's Contracting LLC"
```
