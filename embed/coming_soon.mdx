This section outlines the features and products we will be working on next. Please contact us if you think there is something missing from this list or youâ€™d like to learn more.

## Transaction tagging

Transaction tagging will allow you to append additional information to a journal entry. This enables the ability to view ledgers, ledger sets, and financial statements by tag.

Common use cases might include:

- Viewing income statement by product type
- Viewing balance sheet by location

## Dataset queries

This feature will allow you to easily query aggregated datasets on your users. This will enable you to do financial analysis on your users by asking questions such as:

- How much do my users spend on salaries, on average?
- How many of my users have more than $1M in revenue?

## Personal card tracking

This feature will allow users to connect their personal cards and tag business transactions on that card.

## Tax filing services

We plan to launch a tax filing service for this coming tax season (2024).

## Full-service bookkeeping

We plan to launch a third tier of Teal that involves full service bookkeeping.
