In many cases to you'll want to use Teal to enrich transaction data from third-party sources used in your application, such as a BaaS provider. You can do so by following these steps:

1. **Retreive your API token from your desired provider (e.g. Unit, Plaid, Stripe Treasury)**
2. **Log into the [Developer Portal integrations page](https://developer.teal.dev/integrations) and find the card for your provider.**
3. **Paste the API token from your provider into the input, and press the _Save Token_ button.**

## Unit Integration

In order to generate a token for Unit, log in to the [API tokens page](https://app.s.unit.sh/api-tokens) in the Unit dashboard.

Teal requires a token with only _**read**_ permission for _**transactions**_.
