**Tier 1** provides users with an enriched view of their business finances. By leveraging the cashflow report, users can understand how much money they are making, and where their money is going.

The cashflow report is built on top ledger sets that are unique to each user. Teal takes care of categorizing most journal entries to their respective ledgers.

## Transaction Categories

You can use the [Get Line Entry Category endpoint](/api-reference/line_entries/get_line_entry_categories) to retrieve the category for a transaction in your system. This API may be used when retrieving categories for individual transactions. However, in cases where categories are required for bulk data (e.g. A user transaction page) we recommend storing categories in your own datastore and subscribing to our Category Updated webhook.

## Cashflow Report

You can use the [Get Cashflow Statement endpoint](/api-reference/reports/get_cashflow_statement) in order to get the data required for producing a cashflow report for a specific user in a specific time range.
