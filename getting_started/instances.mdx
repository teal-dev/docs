<Warning>Needs to be updated</Warning>

A user in your Teal platform represents your end customer's small business. This means that a user always has a single set of "books". You can create 
and configure users in Teal, and you will need to store the association between a user in your Teal platform and their associated entity in your product. 


<Note>
  Remember to store the association between a user in your Teal platform and their associated entity in your product. 
</Note>

## Creating a user

You can create users on your Teal platform by using the [Create User API](/api-reference/users/create_user). 

### Subscription Level

By default, users are created with a **Tier 0** subscription. To enable **Tier 1 or 2** features, upgrade the user 
subscription using the [Update Subscription endpoint](/api-reference/users/update_subscription). Remember 
that there are different charges depending on subscription level. Sandbox subscriptions incur no charges.

### Start date

It's important to be mindful in setting the start date (`entries_start`) for a user. The start date is the date from which 
the user's bookkeeping will be tracked. You will not be able to enter any transactions or 
journal entries, or generate reports before the start date. 

If the user is switching from another accounting platform, you will generally set a start date that is 
the beginning of the financial year that they will begin tracking their books on your platform. The will enter 
[opening balances](/transactions/opening_balances) to set up their balance sheet properly so that it is accurate on the start date. (Tier 2 only)

If the user is not switching from another platform, and intends to track their books from the opening date of 
the business, then set the start date as the opening date of the business.

### Chart of accounts

When you create a new user using the [Create User endpoint](/api-reference/users/create_user), you will need to select a
 [chart of accounts](/configuration/chart_of_accounts_config) template for their ledgers to be generated from, 
 by using the `coa_template_id` parameter.
