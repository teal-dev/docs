<Note>
  We recommend first completing [Quick start: Reports](setup) before following this guide.
</Note>

This Quick start guide will walk you through the steps to configure Teal's auto-categorization feature by using 
the cash flow report from the previous guide.  

## 1. Configure the auto-categorization pipeline
Start by opening the **Categorization** section of the [Developer portal](https://developer.teal.dev/categorization). 
Here you will see the auto-categorization pipeline. This pipeline will execute whenever a new transaction is submitted 
via the [Create Transaction endpoint](/api-reference/transactions/create_transactions), or is fetched by Teal via a data integration. 
Auto-categorization provides a better user experience for the end user, as they will not need to manually categorize the majority of transactions. 

The auto-categorization pipeline consists of three categorization steps, each of which can be indepedently enabled and configured. We won't go into a lot of detail in this quick start, but you can visit [categorization configuration](/configuration/categorization_config) for more information. 

For the purposes of this step in the quickstart guide, we recommend enabling all three steps of the auto-categorization pipeline. 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion

  title="Transfers Between Accounts"
  >
    This feature recognizes when a transaction is a transfer of funds between two financial accounts. 
    Tracking the movements of funds between financial accounts is important as they are are movements of cash 
    within the business, rather than into or out of the business. This ensures that these transactions are 
    not "double counted" as cash inflows or cash outflows.

    <Tip>
    We recommend enabling this feature in most circumstances.

    title="Categorization Rules"
  >
    Platforms have the ability to set their own categorization rules. This feature enables you to define 
    specific rules, which, when matched, will automatically categorize a transaction into a particular ledger.

    We provide a lot of flexibility around crafting these rules (details can be [found here](/configuration/categorization_config)). 
    For this guide, we suggest experimenting with some basic rules such as: 
    1. Categorize a transaction based on vendor description:
    ```python
    match("Slack", t.description)
    ```
    2. Categorize a transaction based on vendor description and above a threshold amount
    ```python
    match("Chevron", t.description) and t.amount > 50
    ```
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion
    icon="circle-3"
    title="AI Categorization"
  >
    You can also turn on AI categorization if you would like AI to attempt to categorize transactions 
    that don't categorize in steps 1 and 2. This features uses a large language model to categorize transactions 
    into the appropriate ledger. Find out more [here](/configuration/categorization_config)

    <Tip>
    Our categorization LLM is under active development and you can expect the accuracy and speed to improve in the coming months.

## 2. Test the auto-categorizer

You can run auto-categorization tests to check the accuracy and recategorize transactions for specific ledgers 
from within the [Developer portal](https://developer.teal.dev/categorization).

Once you are ready to test your auto-categorization configuration, select the user we created in the [Quick start 1: Reports guide](/getting_started/quickstart) from the dropdown menu. Select a financial account ledger in the dropdown menu. Now you can click **Run Test** to view the output of auto-categorization for the transactions contained in that ledger. Running the test will give a preview of the auto-categorization results, but will not apply the changes to the user's data.

When you are satisfied with the results of the auto-categorizer, you can click **Recategorize** to push these changes to the user's data. You can now generate a new cash flow report with the updated categories. 

<Warning>
    **Recategorizing** will delete and recreate all transactions in the ledger with the updated categories and associated journal entries.
    </Warning>

## 3. View an updated cash flow report

As outlined in [Quick start: Reports](/getting_started/Quickstart), generating a cash flow report is an as simple as 
calling the [Get Cash flow endpoint](/api-reference/reports/get_cash_flow_report).

    ``` Shell
    curl --request get \
    --url 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/reports/users/{user_id}/cash-flow-report?start_date=start_date&end_date=end_date' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
     ```

Congratulations! The new cash flow report object now displays the updated categories. 

## What to explore next

This is the end of the quickstart guide. You're now ready to dive into Teal's more detailed guides on how to build your accounting software offering.

A good next step is to visit the [Cash Flow Report guide](/reports/cash_flow). This guide will go into further detail on the Cash Flow report and how to embed it into your front-end application so the end user can interact with it.
