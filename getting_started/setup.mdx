<Steps>
  <Step title="Provision your Platform">
    
    A Platform is Teal's representation of your business, with its own configuration, data, and users. All of Teal's APIs operate 
    within the scope of a Platform.

    We provision your Platform for you. If you do not already have a provisioned Platform, reach out to your Teal contact or 
    visit the [Teal home page](https://teal.dev) to get in touch.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a developer account">

    Once we have provisioned your Platform, you can access our [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). 
    You will need to create an account using your company email address. 

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a Sandbox API token">

    <Warning>
    Tokens should always be kept secret. Don't share outside of your organization and be careful when sharing within.
    </Warning>

    Calls to our API are authenticated using a bearer token and are sent to our API using an `Authentication: Bearer <token>` 
    HTTP header. 
    
    You can create which can create and manage these tokens in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). 
    Tokens are unique to your Platform and to the API environment. 

    We support two different API environemnts: 
      - **Sandbox:** `https://api.sandbox.teal.dev`
      - **Production:** `https://api.teal.dev`

    Our sandbox environment is separate from our production environment. Sandbox is intended to be used during development.


  </Step>

  <Step title="Call the API">
    Test that you are setup to access the API by making a test call. Run the following cURL command in your client or 
    use the [API Reference](/api-reference/authentication) in our docs. Replace `{API token}` with the appropriate values for 
    your sandbox Platform.

    ```bash Shell
    curl --location --request GET 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/platform' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {API token}'
    ```
    If successful, you should see a response that looks like the following:

    ```json JSON
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "name": "Platform Name"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
