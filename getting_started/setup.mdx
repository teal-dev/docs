## Overview

Teal APIs are accessible using REST and can be reached via two different endpoints.

- **Sandbox:** `https://api.sandbox.teal.dev`
- **Production:** `https://api.teal.dev`

Our sandbox environment is separate from our production environment. Sandbox is intended to be used during development.

## 1. Provision your Platform

A Platform is Teal's representation of your business, with its own configuration, data, and users. All of Teal's APIs operate within the scope of a Platform.

We provision your Platform for you. If you do not already have a provisioned Platform, reach out to your Teal contact or visit the [Teal home page](https://teal.dev) to get in touch.

## 2. Create a developer account

Once we have provisioned your Platform, you will be able to access our [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). The first time you visit the portal you will need to create an account using your email address.

<Note>
  Your email address must match the address we have on file. If you want to use a
  different email for access or add additional developer emails, please reach
  out to us.
</Note>

## 3. Generate an API token

Once you are in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/), you can create API tokens to access the API. 
Be sure to take note of the token value as you can't retrieve this later. You can create multiple tokens and they do not expire.

Calls to our API are authenticated using a bearer token and are sent to our API using an `Authentication: Bearer <token>` HTTP header.

<Warning>
  Tokens should always be kept secret. Don't share outside of your organization
  and be careful when sharing within.
</Warning>

Tokens can be managed at our [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). You will only be able to generate tokens after a Platform has been provisioned for your company.

## 4. Make your first API call

Test that you have successfully created an API token for your Platform. Run the following cURL command in your client or do so from our [API Reference](/api-reference/authentication), replacing `{API token}` with the appropriate values for your sandbox Platform.

```bash Shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/platform' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {API token}'
```

If successful, you should see a response that looks like the following:

```json JSON
{
  "id": 18327,
  "name": "Pauly's Pet Palace"
}
```
