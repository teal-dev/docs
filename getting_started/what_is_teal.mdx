Teal is a platform upon which you can build accounting features and services for your small business customers to use. The platform is flexible 
and intended to be customized to your own use case.

Here are examples of the kinds of offerings you can build with Teal:

- A simple enhancement to a banking offering that allows customers to analyze their cash flow. (e.g. "Mint for your small business").
- Accounting features powered with 2-way sync to a customer's existing accounting package (e.g. QuickBooks, Xero), such as 
dashboards, charts, custom reports, and workflows.
- A fully-featured accounting suite that allows customers to prepare and manage their bookkeeping and accounting.
- A managed bookkeeping service which prepares bookkeeping on customers' behalf with live bookkeepers. **(coming in 2024)**
- A tax filing service that collects tax documents from customers and combines it with their bookkeeping data to 
prepare and file their business income tax returns. **(coming in 2024)**

Often, the most valuable implementation is a combination of these offerings. For example, a neobank might offer a simple cash flow 
analysis tool for free, with an upgrade path to a full-featured accounting suite that 2-way syncs to a customer's QuickBooks account, 
which can be further upgraded with a built-in live bookkeeper and tax filer.

Teal offers native integrations with external data sources such as Plaid, Unit, Stripe, and QuickBooks, with more coming soon. 
It also supports integrations with your own data sources for data such as banking transactions and balances, payroll data, payments data, and more.

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cash flow analysis app">

You can use Teal to build a simple but powerful cash flow analysis app that shows your customers where their cash started in the 
month, where it ended, and what kinds of transactions moved their cash balance up and down.

This style of app is sometimes called "mint for business."

Here is an example implemented inside the UI for a fictional neobank called Pluto:

<Accordion title="Full accounting suite">

You can use Teal to build a complex fully featured accounting suite. This suite can be a standalone suite, or 2-way sync to popular accounting 
packages such as QuickBooks.

The below example shows a small portion of the full accounting suite for a fictional platform called Pluto, including financial statements, 
and the ability to create custom journal entries:
