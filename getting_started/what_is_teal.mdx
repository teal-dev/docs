## What is Teal

Teal is a platform upon which you can build accounting software and services for your small business customers to use. The platform is flexible and intended to be customized to your own use case.

Here are examples of the kinds of offerings you can build with Teal:

- A simple enhancement to a banking offering that allows customers to analyze their cashflow. (e.g. "Mint for your small business")
- A fully-featured accounting application that allows customers to prepare and manage their bookkeeping. (e.g. "An integrated replacement for Quickbooks")
- A managed bookkeeping service prepares bookkeeping on customers' behalf with live bookkeepers. **(coming in 2024)**
- A tax filing service that collects tax documents from customers and combines it with their Teal bookkeeping data to prepare and file their business income tax returns. **(coming in 2024)**

Often, the most valuable implementation is a combination of these offerings. For example, a neobank might offer a simple cashflow analysis tool for free, with an upgrade path to a full-featured accounting suite removes their customers' need for Quickbooks, which can be further upgraded with a built-in bookkeeper and tax filer.

Teal offers native integrations with external data sources such as Unit, Plaid, and Stripe, with more coming soon. It also supports integration with your own data sources for data such as banking transactions and balances, payroll data, payments data, etc.
