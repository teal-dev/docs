A Platform is Teal's representation of your business, with its own configuration, data, and users. All of Teal's APIs operate within the scope of 
a Platform.

We provision your Platform for you. If you do not already have a provisioned Platform, reach out to your Teal contact or visit 
the [Teal home page](https://teal.dev) to get in touch.

## 2. Create a developer account

Once we have provisioned your Platform, you will be able to access our [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). The first time you 
visit the portal you will need to create an account using your email address.

<Note>
  Your email address must match the address we have on file. If you want to use a
  different email for access or add additional developer emails, please reach
  out to us.
</Note>

## 3. Generate an API token

Once you are in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/), you can create API tokens to access the API. 
Be sure to take note of the token value as you can't retrieve this later. You can create multiple tokens and they do not expire.

Calls to our API are authenticated using a bearer token and are sent to our API using an `Authentication: Bearer <token>` HTTP header.

<Warning>
  Tokens should always be kept secret. Don't share outside of your organization
  and be careful when sharing within.
</Warning>

Tokens can be managed at our [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/). You will only be able to generate tokens after a Platform has 
been provisioned for your company.
