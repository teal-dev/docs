Being able to review and confirm the categories of your business transactions is a key accounting workflow. We make it easy to build 
an interface using our API.

When a transaction is created in Teal it has the following attributes:  
```json JSON
    {
      "id": "t_9237232",
      "description": "Example transaction",
      "datetime": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "amount": 100,
      "metadata": {
        "location": "TX, USA",
        "vendor_type": "Gas station"
      },
      "review_status": "reviewed",
      "posted_status": "posted"
    }
    ```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Display list of transactions for review">
    All transactions are initially created with the `transaction_status` attribute set to `unreviewed`. 
    
    Use the [Get Categorized Transactions](/api-reference/transactions/get-categorized-transactions) endpoint and filter by 
    `transaction_status` = `unreviewed` to get a list of `unreviewed` transactions and their associated categories. 
    
    Display these transactions and associated categories to your user. 

  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt the user to review the transaction">
    Prompt the user to review the transaction category. Allow the user to recategorize the transaction by displaying the available ledgers 
    using the [Get Ledgers](/api-reference/ledgers/get-ledgers) endpoint, and the [Recategorize Transaction](/api-reference/transactions/recategorize-transaction) 
    endpoint. 
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt the user to confirm the transaction">
    Once the user has reviewed the transaction, either by confirming the category or selecting a new one, use the [Update Transaction Status](/api-reference/transactions/update-transaction-status) endpoint to update the 
    `transaction_status` to `reviewed`. 
  </Step>
