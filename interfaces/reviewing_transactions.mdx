The goal of categorizing transactions is to ensure that your user's accounting reports are accurate. Teal's auto-categorization pipeline streamlines much of this tedious process, but there are times where you will want to prompt your users to confirm some transactions.

We call this key accounting workflow **Reviewing Transactions**, and versions of this workflow existing in most popular accounting products. Using a combination of the [Transactions](/api-reference/transactions/get-categorized-transactions) and [Ledger](/api-reference/transactions/get-ledgers) endpoints, you can build a customizable transaction review workflow for your unique needs.

### Set up

This guide assumes your platform is set up and you have at least one [instance](/accounting_package/add_instance) with an accounting package.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Display unreviewed Transactions">
		Use the [Get Categorized Transactions](/api-reference/transactions/get-categorized-transactions) endpoint with the `ledger_id` of a specific ledger to get a list of all `unreviewed` transactions.

		```tsx
		const options = {
			method: 'GET',
			headers: {
				Authorization: AUTHORIZATION_KEY
				'teal-instance-id': TEAL_INSTANCE_ID,
			}
		};
		const ledger_id = 12345;

		const request = await fetch(`https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/ledgers/${ledger_id}/transactions/categories?review_status=unreviewed`, options)
		const data = await request.json();
		```
		Display these to the user by iterating over `data.records`.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Update the category (Optional)">	
		Sometimes a user needs to change how a Transaction is categorized. To do this, you need a list of all Ledgers and then allow the user to select which one they would like to assign as the new category.

		1. Use the [Get Ledgers](/api-reference/transactions/get-ledgers) endpoint to retrieve all Ledgers.

    	```tsx
    	const options = {
    		method: 'GET',
    		headers: {
    			Authorization: AUTHORIZATION_KEY,
    			'teal-instance-id': TEAL_INSTANCE_ID
    		}
    	};
    	const request = await fetch(`https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/ledgers`, options)
    	const data = await request.json();
    	```
		
		Display the possible ledgers in a `<select>` element by iterating over `data.records`.

		2. After a user has selected a category, submit the `ledger_id` of the new category to the [Recategorize Transaction](/api-reference/transactions/recategorize-transaction) endpoint.

		```tsx
		const selected_ledger_id = '67890';

		const options = {
			method: 'PUT',
			headers: {
				Authorization: AUTHORIZATION_KEY,
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				'teal-instance-id': TEAL_INSTANCE_ID
			},
			body: {
				"updated_category_ledger_id": selected_ledger_id
			}
		};
		const ledger_id = 12345;

		const request = await fetch(`https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/ledgers/${ledger_id}/transactions/${transaction_id}/categories`, options)
		const response = await request.json();
		```
    </Step>

	<Step title="Save the updated Transaction">
		When you&rsquo;re ready, update the Transaction `review_status` from `unreviewed` to `reviewed` using the [Update Transaction Status](/api-reference/transactions/update-transaction-status) endpoint with `ledger_id` and `transaction_id`, passing along the new review status.

		```tsx
		const options = {
			method: 'PUT',
			headers: {
				Authorization: AUTHORIZATION_KEY,
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				'teal-instance-id': TEAL_INSTANCE_ID
			},
			body: {
				"review_status": "reviewed"
			}
		};

		const request = await fetch(`https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/ledgers/${ledger_id}/transactions/${transaction_id}`, options);
		const response = await request.json();
		```
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Notes
- When a Transaction is processed in Teal's auto-categorization pipeline and it does not match any ledger, it will be categorized as either the "uncategorized inflow" or "uncategorized outflow", depending on if the Transaction is a credit or a debit.
