Teal APIs are accessible using REST and can be reached via two different endpoints.

- Sandbox: `https://api.sandbox.teal.dev`
- Production: `https://api.teal.dev`

Our sandbox environment is separate from our production environment. Sandbox is intended to be used during development. Production data should not be stored in the sandbox.

<Warning>
  The API is in an early version 0 state and is currently not stable. There may
  be breaking changes.
