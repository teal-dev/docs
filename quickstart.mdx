This guide will walk you through the steps to build a cashflow report, all while helping you familiarize yourself with the Teal API and configuring your platform along the way.

## By the end of this guide you will have:

- **Set up your Platform with a default configuration (which you can modify later)**
- **Created a User and selected a chart of accounts template**
- **Linked the User to an external data source**
- **Generated a cashflow report from the User's transactions**

Sounds good? Let's get started.

## 1. Set up your platform

**Objective: set up your Platform with a default configuration (which you can modify later)**

Teal APIs are accessible using REST and can be reached via our Sandbox or Production endpoints. For this exercise, you'll be using the Sandbox endpoints:`https://api.sandbox.teal.dev`. See [Overview](overview) for more info.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
    icon="circle-1"
    title="Generate a Teal Sandbox API token"
  >
  First up, you will want to log into your [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev). Next, you will want to create a Sandbox API token. Make sure you are viewing the Sandbox (top right of the page). Enter the name of your token (e.g. Quickstart Cashflow) and click Generate Token. You should then see your token credential. Copy and save this token somewhere safe as you will need it to use the Teal API going forward.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="circle-2" title="Obtain default Chart of Accounts template_id">

Now that you have a token, visit the [Chart of Accounts](https://developer.teal.dev/chart_of_accounts) page. You should see your default chart of accounts templates already loaded. For the purposes of this Quickstart we will use an existing default. Copy and save the `template_id` of an existing default, you will need it to create a **User** and generate your cashflow report.

<Tip>
  You can view and edit these templates through the Developer Portal or via the
  API. You'll likely want to do this later when you get to tailoring your chart
  of accounts based on your unique user's needs.

## 2. Build your first report

**Objective: generate a cashflow statement to see the results of the Teal API in action**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
    icon="circle-1"
    title="Create a User and assign them to a Chart of Accounts"
  >
    Create a new user by calling the [Create User endpoint](/api-reference/users/create_user). Replace the query
    parameters with your desired user name, the `coa_template_id` that you
    copied from the [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev), and the relevant start date for your
    new user.

    ``` Shell
    curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/users?name=John%20Smith&entries_start=STARTDATE&coa_template_id=TEMPLATEID' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
     --header 'authorization: Bearer APIKEY'
     ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="circle-2" title="Link User bank account to a Teal ledger">

    You probably want to use Teal to transform real-world business transactions into accounting information. To enable this, you need to connect to external data sources. Before proceeding make sure that you have the appropriate permissions from your users.

    To see this in action, we will link one of your User's Unit bank accounts to their Teal ledger.

    ```Shell
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/reports/users/user_id/cashflow-statement \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header 'authorization: Bearer APIKEY'
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="circle-3" title="Generate a Cashflow Statement">

    Real-world transactions are flowing into your User's Teal ledger and being categorized to their chart of accounts. This enriched view of a User's business is very helpful in understanding financial performance and overall health.

    You will see that generating a cashflow statement is a simple as calling the [Get Cashflow endpoint](/api-reference/reports/get_cashflow_statement).

    ``` Shell
    curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.sandbox.teal.dev/v0/reports/users/user_id/cashflow-statement?start_date=STARTDATE&end_date=ENDDATE' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer APIKEY'
     ```
