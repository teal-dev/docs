## What is a balance sheet?

A balance sheet is one of the foundational financial statements used in accounting. It shows a business' assets, liabilities, and equity 
at a given point in time. 

This differs from many of the other financial statements such as the P&L, which reports on transactions over a period of time, instead 
of just balances at a point in time.

The balances in a balance sheet are generated from the all transactions that have occurred in the business since the start of the 
business. This makes it more difficult to get right, as more data is required than just transactions for the period of time in question.

## How does Teal's balance sheet report work?

The balance sheet returns and array of ledger summaries for ledger types equal to asset, liability, and equity.  It also returns calculated totals 
that are typically included in an balance sheet, such as `sub_type` totals (e.g. "Total Current Assets") and "Retained Earnings". 
The values in the report are calculated based on all line entries in each ledger going back to the user's start date, plus any opening balances.

The balance sheet ties to the income statement report via this special calculated total called "Retained earnings". Retained earnings is the cumulative 
profit calculated from the sum of the revenue and expense ledgers from the beginning of the business up until the date of the balance sheet report.

<Note> Ledger summaries are returned in the order that you can render them in your user interface. This makes it easy to display a conventional income 
statement with minimal effort.</Note>

## Opening balances

If the business was operating and transacting before the user's start date, then opening balances will need to be set in order for the balance 
sheet to be accurate. See our [Opening Balances guide](/transactions/opening_balances) for more information.

## Generating the balance sheet report

You can use the [Get Balance Sheet endpoint](/api-reference/reports/get_balance_sheet) in order to get the data required for producing a balance sheet.

## Creating the balance sheet UI

In order to create a useful balance sheet interface for your users, we recommend adding two UI elements to your report:

- a date picker
- the ability to explore the transactions that are within each listed ledger using the [ledger statement report](/reports/ledger_statement) for each ledger

The [reports interfaces](/interfaces/reports) page provides details and code snippets on how to implement these features.

## Pricing

Please note that the balance sheet endpoint requires the user to have a Tier 2 subscription.
