## What is a general ledger report?

The general ledger lists every ledger in the chart of account, and every line entry in that ledger, as well as the opening and closing balances. It is most commonly used by accountants and bookkeepers to make year-end adjustments and prepare tax returns. As this report is verbose, we recommend offering this report primarily as an Excel export rather than a web-based report.
