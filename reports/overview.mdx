You can use Teal to generate financial reports for your customers that look and behave the same regardless of their chosen accounting package.

Our reports include the standard accounting financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow report), as well as more detailed 

The transaction data from your embedded financial products needs to accurately flow into your customer's accounting or else their accounting reports 
(and ultimately year-end tax filing) will be wrong. Your customers probably expect this to happen automatically, but it's harder than it sounds to 
get this right. Our Accounting API is designed to support this important use case.  

In order for an end user (your customer) to successfully represent their transactions in their accounting package, they must have a separate ledger 
for each financial account they need to track, and each ledger must contain the complete set of transactions within the account of that financial 
product. This section breaks down how to set up these financial account ledgers appropriately, how to submit transactions, 
reconcile them (i.e. double check that we have the full set), and then apply the appropriate accounting treatment.
