## Creating ledgers

The first step to working with transactions is to create a ledger for the corresponding financial account that the transactions will belong to. Each bank account, credit card, loan, or other financial account should have its own individual ledger.  

If you already have access to financial accounts for the customer, for example because you already serve them a banking product, then it's a good idea to a ledger for each financial account as soon as you create the user's account in Teal.

If you will be allowing customers to track financial accounts that you do not yet have access to, for example via Plaid, then it's a good idea to create an interface that allows them to define what financial accounts they have, and create a ledger for each one. 

When you first create a user in Teal, you need to specify the user's start date. No transactions are allowed to be entered into Teal before this start date. If the financial account has been open before the user's Teal start date, then it's important for the opening balance on the Teal ledger must match the balance in the financial account on the start date. There is a dedicated feature for opening balances coming soon, however, until then you can simply create a journal entry on the start date with the title "Opening balance", and debit/credit the correct amount to the ledger so that the balance is correct on the opening date. This will ensure that later, the balance will be correct in the user's accounting reports. 

### Setting up sort codes

When you create the ledger for a financial account, it is important to give the ledger a sort code appropriate to the kind of financial account it is, so that it is captured in the appropriate totals defined in the user's chart of accounts.

If you are using Teal's default chart of accounts, here are the recommended sort codes for each kind of financial account:

Bank accounts: 1011-1099
Credit cards: 2001-2099
Loans and lines of credit: 2101-2199

If you are not using Teal's default chart of accounts for your users, its important to establish what range of sort codes you will use for each type of financial account, and make sure that the appropriate ledger totals have been set up so that these accounts display and total properly in the user's accounting reports.

### Naming ledgers

When creating a ledger, it's important to give it a descriptive name so the end user can distinguish which account is which in case they ever open a 2nd account of the same type. We recommend using a naming convention that includes the last 4 digits of the account number, which is generally considered not to be sensitive information. For security and compliance reasons, we do not recommend including any more digits than the last four.

For example, "Chase Checking **5959" is a good name for a ledger, whereas "Bank Account 1" is not.

## Connect the user's external data source

In many cases, you will want to pull in a user's transaction data from their third-party financial accounts (e.g. Unit, Plaid). You can do this by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have configured your platform to pull data from the external data source (see [Data Sources Configuration](/configuration/data_sources_config))
2. Create a ledger for the financial account by using the [Create Ledger endpoint](/api-reference/ledgers/create_ledger). For bank accounts, you should use the following query parameters:

```
 "sort_code"="unique_number"
 "name"="unique_name"
 "ledger_type"=asset
 "debit_credit"=debit
 "financial_account_type"=bank_account
 "report_cashflow"=true
```

3. Link the user's financial account to this ledger by using the [Link Unit Account endpoint](/api-reference/transaction_sources/link_unit_account).
