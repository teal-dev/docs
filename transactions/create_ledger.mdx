## Creating financial account ledgers

The first step to working with transactions is to create a ledger for the corresponding financial 
account that the transactions will belong to. We support multiple types of financial accounts and 
set smart defaults based on the `financial_account_type` selected. For example, if you set 
`financial_account_type` to bank, we set `type` to asset, `debit_credit` to debit, and 
`report_cash_flow` to true. Each financial acount should have its own individual ledger. You can see the 
complete list of supported financial account types [here](/api-reference/ledgers/create_ledger).

If you already have access to financial accounts for the customer, for example because you already 
serve them a banking or payroll product, then it's a good idea to create a ledger for each financial 
account as soon as you create the user's account in Teal.

If you will be allowing customers to track financial accounts that you do not yet have access 
to, for example via Plaid, then it's a good idea to create an interface that allows them 
to define what financial accounts they have, and create a ledger for each one.

When you first [create a user](/api-reference/users/create_user) in Teal, you need to specify the user's start date (`entries_start`). No 
transactions are allowed to be entered into Teal before this start date. If the financial 
account has been open before the user's start date, then it's important for the 
[opening balance](/transactions/opening_balances) on the Teal ledger to match the balance 
in the financial account on the start date. There is a dedicated feature for opening balances 
coming soon, however, until then you can simply create a journal entry on the start date with 
the title "Opening balance", and debit/credit the correct amount to the ledger so that the 
balance is correct on the user's start date. This will ensure that later, the balance will 
be correct in the user's accounting reports.

### Setting up sort codes

When you create the ledger for a financial account, it is important to give the ledger 
a `sort_code` appropriate to the kind of financial account it is.

If you are using Teal's default chart of accounts, here are the recommended sort codes for the 
major financial account types:

- Bank accounts: 1011-1099
- Credit cards: 2001-2099
- Loans (and lines of credit): 2101-2199

### Naming ledgers

When creating a financial account ledger, it's important to give it a descriptive name so 
the end user can distinguish which account is which in case they ever open a 2nd account 
of the same type. We recommend using a naming convention that includes the last 4 digits 
of the account number, which is generally considered not to be sensitive information. For 
security and compliance reasons, we do not recommend including any more digits than the last four.

For example, "Chase Checking \*\*5959" is a good name for a ledger, whereas "Bank Account 1" is not.

## Connect the user's external data source

In many cases, you will want to pull in a user's transaction data from their third-party 
financial accounts (e.g. Unit, Plaid). You can do this by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have configured your platform to pull data from the external data 
source (see [Data Sources Configuration](/configuration/data_sources_config))
2. Create a ledger for the financial account by using the 
[Create Ledger endpoint](/api-reference/ledgers/create_ledger). For bank accounts, you 
should use the following query parameters:

```
 "sort_code"="unique_number"
 "name"="unique_name"
 "ledger_type"=asset
 "debit_credit"=debit
 "financial_account_type"=bank_account
 "report_cash_flow"=true
```

3. Link the user's financial account to this ledger by using the [Link Unit Account endpoint](/api-reference/transaction_sources/link_unit_account).

## Making ledgers non-user-editable

If you control the financial account (e.g. via a neobanking/Baas offering), then you may 
want to make the ledger non-user-editable by setting the `user_editable` parameter to False 
when using the [Create Ledger endpoint](/api-reference/ledgers/create_ledger). This will 
prevent the user from editing any line entry that is assigned to the ledger. They will still 
be able to categorize the transactions and edit the rest of the journal entry. This feature 
ensures that the user does not accidently break the sync between the Teal ledger and the 
transactions submitted from the financial account.

For example, if you submit a transaction for a \$10 expense for "Starbucks" using the 
[Create Transaction endpoint](/transactions/submitting), Teal will automatically generate a 
journal entry with two line entries. One line entry will credit \$10 to the bank account ledger, 
the other line entry will debit \$10 to an expense ledger (depending on your 
[auto-categorization config](/configuration/categorization_config)). If the bank account ledger 
is set to user_editable = False, then the user will be able to change the \$10 debit to the 
expense ledger, but not the \$10 credit to the bank account ledger.

If the transactions data source is a data aggregator such as Plaid, it is not recommended to 
make the ledger non-user-editable. Aggregators sometimes miss transactions that the user must 
manually enter, and if the ledger is non-user-editable, the user will not be able to 
enter the transaction to correct the error.
