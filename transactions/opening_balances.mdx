The balances in a balance sheet are generated from the all transactions that have occurred in the business since the start of the business. This makes it more difficult to get right, as more data is required than just transactions for the period of time in question.

If the business was operating and transacting before the userâ€™s start date, then opening balances will need to be set in order for the balance sheet to be accurate. See our Opening Balances guide for more information.
