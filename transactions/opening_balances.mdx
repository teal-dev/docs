## What is an opening balance

The balances in a balance sheet are generated from the all transactions that have occurred in the business since the start of the business. If the business was operating and transacting before the user's `start date`, then opening balances will need to be set for the user's assets, liabilities, and equity ledgers in order for the balance sheet to be accurate. An opening balance in a ledger increases the ledger's value on the `start date` to account for what the balance sheet should look like on the user's `start date`.

For example, if a user had $500 in a bank account on their `start date`, an opening balance debiting 500 to the bank ledger would need to be made. Without an opening balance, the bank ledger would incorrectly report $0 on the user's `start date`.

## Opening balance development

This feature is currently in development with a planned release in August 2023. Please contact our team if you need to work with opening balances before then.
