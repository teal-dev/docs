## Creating ledgers

The first step to submitting transactions, is to create a ledger for the corresponding financial account that the transactions belong to. Each bank account, credit card, loan, or other financial account should have its own individual ledger.  

If the account has been open before the user's Teal start date, then the opening balance on the Teal ledger must match the balance in the 

## Submitting transaction data

In order for Teal to generate a report for a user, it first needs accounting journal entries in its database. The primary way for you to generate these journal entries is to submit transactions to Teal. Once Teal receives a transaction, it will automatically generate a two-sided journal entry to be used in generating reports.

There are a two ways to submit transactions to Teal, either using the _insert endpoint here_ endpoint, or by configuring an external data source.

### Endpoint

Fill in this section when the endpoint is published.

### External data source

Once you have [configured an external data source](/configuration/data_sources_config) in the developer portal, you can link a ledger to this data source using the [transactions sources endpoint](/api-reference/transaction_sources/).

When a ledger is successfully linked with this endpoint, Teal will poll the data source for new transactions and input them into the ledger when they are available. It will also automatically check for missing or incorrect transactions and give an alert if it finds them.
