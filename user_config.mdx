## Steps

1. **Create users**
2. **Manage user ledgers**
3. **Connect user's external data sources**
4. **Manage journal entries**

## 1. Create Users

Users represent the businesses (end customers) you serve. For your users to use Teal, you will need to create a corresponding user on the Teal platform.

You can create users on your Teal platform using the Create User API. When you create a user you will assign them a chart of account template.

<Note>
  Remember to store the association users on your platform and their Teal
  counterparts.
</Note>

### Subscription Level

By default, users are created with a **Tier 0** subscription. To unlock **Tier 1 or 2** features, upgrade the user subscription using the [Update Subscription endpoint](/api-reference/users/update_subscription). Remember that there are the difference charges depending on subscription level in product. Sandbox subscriptions incur no charges.

## 2. Manage user ledgers

<Info>
  Ledgers group related journal entries, providing a summary of real-world
  transactions.
</Info>

There will be cases where a user will need to create a unique ledger that was not defined in their chat of account template. A common use case is a ledger that tracks an external data source such as a bank account.

You can manage ledgers for your users using the [Users endpoint](/api-reference/users/).

## 3. Connect user's external data sources

In most cases, you will want to pull in a user's transaction data from their third-party financial accounts (e.g. Unit). You can do this by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have configured your platform to pull data from the external data source (see [Platform Configuration](/platform_config))
2. Create a ledger for the financial account by using the [Create Ledger endpoint](/api-reference/ledgers/create_ledger). For bank accounts, you should use the following query parameters:

```
 "sort_code"="unique_number"
 "name"="unique_name"
 "ledger_type"=asset
 "debit_credit"=debit
 "is_cash"=true
```

3. Link the user's financial account to this ledger by using the /source/links endpoint _(under construction)_

## 4. Manage journal entries

<Info>
  A journal entry represents a transaction in our accounting model. Each journal
  entry includes debit and credit line entries to and from different ledgers,
  ensuring the sum of credits equals the sum of debits.
</Info>

You can use the [Create Journal Entry endpoint](/api-reference/journal_entries/create_journal_entry) to create a journal entry (with respective line entries) for a user.

<Note>
  You are responsible for storing the association between a transaction in your
  service and a line entry in Teal.
</Note>

Journal entries can be updated using the [Update Journal Entry endpoint](/api-reference/journal_entries/update_journal_entry). A common reason for updating a journal entires is to modify it's associated line entries. Updates maintain the sum of credits equals sum of debits rule.

## Other: Create sample data

You can leverage Teal's sample data for the purposes of testing your configuration. From the [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/), generate data for your platform in the sandbox environment.

1. Log into the [Developer Portal](https://developer.teal.dev/) and navigate to the **Sandbox** tab.
2. In your platform's menu, select **Generate Sample User** (see example)

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/generate_sample_user.png" />
</Frame>

The sample user will have **Tier 2** subscription and be populated with a chart of accounts for a **C-Corp** with journal entries dating back a year.
